# ML Algorithms

A collection of personal machine learning algorithm implementations and experiments. I created these to further teach myself how common ML algorithms operate underneath the hood.

## Projects

### K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models
Clustering algorithms including K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for unsupervised learning tasks.

### Linear Classification
Implementation of linear classification methods for supervised learning problems.

### Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees
Classical machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier and Decision Tree implementations.

### Neural Language Model
Neural network-based language modeling with text generation and word embedding exploration.

### Neural Networks
Fundamental neural network implementations and experiments.
